# Maker's Week 1: Weekly challenge
This challenge was the first of my Maker's weekly challenges, coded in pairs with a randomised partner each day.
The learning objectives for this week were:

* Test Driven Development (TDD) using RSpec
* Follow an appropriate debugging process to 'tighten the loop' and 'gain visbility' when faced with bugs
* Basic class structure and attributes

```

# boris_bike_challenge
This is a program designed to let a user rent a bike by using multiple payment systems via a docking station. 

The docking station can accept payments, release and dock a bike, and can check the status of the bike.
